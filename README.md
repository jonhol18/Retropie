# RetroiPie build on Raspberry Pie 3
 
Live demo presentation of this build can be found: https://youtu.be/23rxE5ZdlpI

In the uploaded version the PS roms are deleted because they took up to much space. Remaining ROMS for SNES and NES is still included in the upload. Retropie builds upon OS Rasbian which is an OS intended for Odroid, Raspberry, or older computers and enables you to create your own "emulationstation" in away.

On top of just installing the OS Retropie, I have also included a special theme, boot sequence, and enabled Bluetooth connection to a PS4 Controller. I also installed an ON/OFF switch. Since this project is from 2017, and my notes etc has since then disappeared I can't recall everything I did with this. But I can remember spending many hours and many late nights going back and forth with different versions, changing and adding code in places and settings I probably shouldn't be touching to start with.

For now, the project is on indefinite hold for a lack of interest. To run this build yourself, you should only need to download the full files and transfer them to a MicroSD card and be good to go.

PS: In hindsight, maybe I should have removed the ROMS for SNES and NES too. Full disclosure, not sure it's 100% legal to upload and download ROMs for old consoles.
